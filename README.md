## Presentation Questions

- Explain the concept of `hoisting` in JavaScript with examples. Why might it confuse beginners and how can they avoid related issues

- Explain the difference between `primitive` and `reference or non-primitive` data types in JavaScript. Give examples of each type and demonstrate how they behave differently when assigned to new variables.

- Explain the concept of `template literals` in JavaScript. How do they differ from traditional string concatenation, and what additional features do they provide for beginners working with strings?
